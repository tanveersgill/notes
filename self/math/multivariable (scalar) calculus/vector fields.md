> one way to think of these is as functions with **n** dimensions for their input and output

- given n inputs, we can essentially make each set of inputs correspond to a n-dimensional vector
	- this makes a "field" of vectors in the input space, which is what we call a vector field

for example,
$$f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\end{bmatrix}$$
- is essentially representing a vector field

***they can also be 3D***
