- I like to think of this as an *extension* of the partial derivative
	- rather than looking at the impact on the output by moving in *a single* direction, a directional derivative looks at it in the direction of some vector

**denoted:**
$$
\displaylines{
\nabla_{\vec{v}}\ f(...)
\\
is\ the\ directional\ derivative\ in\ the\ direction\ of\ \vec{v}
\\
for\ the\ function\ f
}
$$
- where v is the vector in whose direction you want the derivative

- recall, before with normal derivatives for single-variable functions, and for partial derivatives, we'd think of the steps in a direction as being very small, approaching 0:
$$\lim_{h\to0}$$
- the same is true when we do it w/ a vector
	- we wanna make the magnitude of that vector approach 0, but maintain its direction
$$
\displaylines{
h \times\vec{v}
\\
where\ h\to0}
$$
***HOW TO COMPUTE:***
1. view it with regards to a function
$$
\displaylines{
for\ a\ vector\ \vec{v},\ the\ directional\ derivative\
\\
is\ the\ sum\ of\ the\ partial\ derivatives\ of\ the\ function,\\ 'scaled'\ based\ on\ the\ vector:
\\\\
\vec{v}=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix},
\\\\
\nabla_{\vec{v}}\ f(x,y)=a\frac{∂}{∂x}(f)\ +\ b\frac{∂}{∂y}(f) 
}
$$
2. view it with regards to the gradient field of the function
	- if you look above, that looks like a vector dot product!$$\nabla_{\vec{v}}\ f(x,y)=\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}\cdot \begin{bmatrix}\frac{∂}{∂x}(f)\\\frac{∂}{∂y}(f)\end{bmatrix}=\vec{v}\ \cdot\ \nabla f$$
	- (between the vector and the partial derivatives)

***a formal definition***
$$
\nabla_{\vec{v}}\ f(\vec{a}) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(\vec{a}+h\vec{v})-f{(\vec{a})}}{h}
$$
- note: this uses vector notation; its basically equivalent to saying f(x,y) instead of f(a)

***graphically (slope):***
