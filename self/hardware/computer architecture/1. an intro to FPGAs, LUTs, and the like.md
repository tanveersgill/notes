<summary>**FPGAs**</summary>
<br>
 - *field programmable gate arrays*
</details>
 - they are highly ***flexible***, unlike microcontrollers, which come programmed to some extent out-of-the-box
	 - can think of them as a chip that essentially does ***nothing***; all functionality is up to you
- ***digital***, not analog

**architecture**
- at a basic level, **2** main building blocks:
1. ***LUTs / Look Up Tables*** (part of CLBs/configurable logic blocks)
	- these are the *functional* components; we get to decide what function they serve
2. ***Switches*** 
	- determine how the LUTs are connected to one another
		- in terms of their inputs and outputs

**multiplexers (MUX)**
	- logic devices that consist of:
		1. 2^**n** data inputs
		2. **n** select inputs
		3. **1** output

		- ^ a 4x1 multiplexer

**LUTs**
- when we speak of programming an FPGA, chances are we're talking about programming a LUT
- it essentially is a **multiplexer**
	- its **data inputs** are a series of 2^n addresses
	- the **select input** is n bits
	- output is a single bit
- in this case, the job of the multiplexer is to pick one data input that corresponds to the select input
	***example:***
	*given 3 bits for select, implementing a function that outputs 1 for when there is multiple 1s in the select, else 0*
	![[Screenshot 2023-04-14 at 9.13.41 PM.png]]
	- we can configure the addresses to contain 1s or 0s based on the desired output, and then to compare it with the select, implementation is up to us:
		- AND reduction or OR reduction, perhaps
		- ( ***++how?*** )

***implementing more complex functions***
- we're not restricted to using a single lookup table!
	- the whole point of an FPGA is to have a ton of these interconnected with ***switches***

> what i wrote above was a 3-bit LUT;
> modern FPGAs tend to use 6-bit LUTs, or ***6-LUTs***
