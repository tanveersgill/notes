***what are the modern building blocks of computers?***
- transistors (pain.)
- logic gates

> **MOS** means metal oxide semiconductor

***semiconductors***
- generally silicon
- you can introduce impurities **selectively** 
	- (boron/phosphorous) -> results in **P-type/N-type** semiconductors
	- this changes the electrical properties of the material, based on bonding and valence

***transistors***
- tricky, i'll give it its own page
