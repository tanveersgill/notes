**I.**
- with ***linear*** circuits, all ***parameters*** are held constant with only voltage and current values changing
	- that means things like capicitance, resistance, inductance remain the same
		- (i'll cover these in later notes)
- meaning **ohm's law holds** for linear; there is a direct proportionality between voltage and current
	- NOT the case for non-linear
		- instead you'd see a *curve* relating voltage and current
		- meaning changes to voltage/current change those *parameters*

**II.** (***++ revisit*** – what do we mean by input/output here?)
- also, they are distinguished based on the relationship between their inputs and outputs
	- if you were to graph a linear circuit's input against its output, you would see a linear graph
		- conversely, a non-linear circuit would have, well, a non-linear graph

***a question:***
> **no physical system is ever perfectly linear, so why do we need to study it??**

***why this is the case:***
- it's *easier* ( still painful ) to solve a linear problem than it would be a non-linear one
- even if over a tiny interval of time, we can model something non-linear as being linear
	- for instance, we could approximate the curve $$f(x) = e^x$$
	- as $$f(x)≈x+1$$
	- in this case, error increases with distance from x=0, but you get the point
