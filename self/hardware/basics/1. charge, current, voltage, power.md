- [ ] review sign convention for voltage
- [ ] power

> side note: some of this stuff reminds me of mechanics; position: charge, velocity: current

~~~
important to keep in mind:
	-> current direction is OPPOSITE the direction of electron flow
also some convention (read more below):
	-> current has to be specified alongside a reference direction!
	-> voltage has to be specified with a +/- pair 
~~~

### charge (Q if constant/q if variable)
	SI: Coulombs (C)
formally:
> a property of matter that makes it experience a force when placed in an ***electromagnetic field*** (see 1.01)

in english:
> hahaha positive and negative thingys

- an electron has $$-1.602*10^{-19}C$$
- and a proton has $$1.602*10^{-19}C\ \ (positive)$$

### current (i)
	SI: Amperes (A) = C/s
- the rate of change of charge w.r.t time!
- **1 ampere** is **1 coulomb** of charge passing through some cross section of a wire in **1 second**
	- so, if 2 coulombs were to pass in a second, we'd have 2 amps, etc.

***convention [current magnitude and direction?]***
> when speaking of the current in some path, there is both an associated **numerical value** and **direction**
> we just have to set up a reference direction.
> 	then, negative charge moving in the (my chosen) reference direction will contribute a negative value to the overall charge. the opposite is true of positive charge.

	here, say electrons are moving in the direction of the long arrow, and that arrow is our reference direction, creating a current of 1A.
	
	current __
	[1] is -1A [the electrons are moving in that direction]
	[2] is 1A 
~~~
**to really solidify this:**

	|-> what matters is [1] reference direction and [2] which way electrons move	
~~~
in english:

>  
> amps => how many coulombs of charge pass through some point in a second (C/s)

this equation holds:
$$i = \frac{dq}{dt}$$
from which we can also derive a definite integral that represents charge transferred over time:
$$\displaylines{dq=i*dt \\ \\ \int_{t_{0}}^{t}dq = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt \\then, evaluating\ the\ left: \\ q(t) - q(t_{0}) = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt \\ finally:\\ q(t) = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt\ +\ q(t_{0})}
$$
### **voltage** (V/v)
	SI: Volts (V) = J/C 
- starting off with a very basic element of a circuit (doesn't matter what it is) with two terminals:

~~~

A -__+ B
 |    |
 |____|

|->	here, if we put a [DC] current in via A, and it comes out at B, there has to be some expenditure of energy to get it through
	|-> that is 'voltage'
	  ðŸ¤”|-> so that explains why it is often analogized w/ a 'push' 
~~~

formally:
> measured *between two points*, it is the change in energy (work that needs to be done) when moving a unit positive charge from a negative to more positive point (lower to higher potential)

in english:
> [add]

- since 1V = 1 J/C:
	- essentially, volts are a measure of how many joules of energy (how much work) it takes to move a coulomb of charge between two points
~~~
note:
	a potential difference (so, voltage) exists regardless of if current is flowing or not
~~~

***convention [sign pairs]*** [incomplete]
- we need a way to distinguish when energy is supplied ***to*** an (arbitrary) element, or supplied ***by*** it
~~~
