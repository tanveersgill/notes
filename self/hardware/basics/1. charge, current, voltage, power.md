### charge (Q if constant/q if variable)
- SI: Coulombs (C)
formally:
> a property of matter that makes it experience a force when placed in an ***electromagnetic field*** (see 1.01)

in english:
> hahaha positive and negative thingys

- an electron has $$-1.602*10^{-19}C$$
- and a proton has $$1.602*10^{-19}C\ \ (positive)$$

### current (i)
- SI: Amperes (A)
	- aka C/s
- the rate of change of charge w.r.t time!
- **1 ampere** is **1 coulomb** of charge passing through some cross section of a wire in **1 second**
	- so, if 2 coulombs were to pass in a second, we'd have 2 amps, etc.
	
in english:
> the movement of charge
>  
> amps => how many coulombs of charge pass through some point in a second (C/s)

this equation holds:
$$i = \frac{dq}{dt}$$
from which we can also derive a definite integral that represents charge transferred over time:
$$\displaylines{dq=i*dt \\ \\ \int_{t_{0}}^{t}dq = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt \\then, evaluating\ the\ left: \\ q(t) - q(t_{0}) = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt \\ finally:\\ q(t) = \int_{t_{0}}^{t}i*dt\ +\ q(t_{0})}
$$
### **voltage**

formally:
> measured *between two points*, it is the change in energy (work that needs to be done) when moving a unit positive charge from a negative to more positive point (lower to higher potential)
