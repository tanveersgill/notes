## electric and magnetic fields
- these are two components of the *electromagnetic* field

***electric fields***
- they're generated by *everything* that has a charge!
- are not a force themselves, but exert an ***electric force*** on anything that enters them

***magnetic fields***
- generated by *moving* charges
- unlike electric fields, which have
