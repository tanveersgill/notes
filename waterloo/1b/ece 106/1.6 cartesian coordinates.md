- for 106, instead of i, j, k, the unit vectors in R^3 are:
$$
\hat{x},\ \hat{y},\ \hat{z}
$$
- as such, every vector in 3D is represented by multiples of these unit vectors

***integration and differential elements in 3D***
- in 2D, to figure out some area we'd have to use a differential area element; some tiny rectangle/square with dimensions:
$$dx, dy$$
- likewise, in 3D we have to deal with differential *volume* elements, which are made of:
$$dx,dy,dz$$
- and this can be applied to find surface areas and volumes for objects

***the differential elements:***
1. length (dl)
$$
\displaylines{
\vec{dl}
\\
= some\ linear\ combination 
\\
dx*\hat{x}+dy*\hat{y}+dz*\hat{z}
}
$$

2. surface (ds)
- in this case, we look at the tiny area element created by multiplying two of dx, dy, dz, and represent it as a vector in the direction of the plane perpendicular to the area itself.
	- for example, an area created by dx and dy would be represented w/ a vector in the z direction
$$
\displaylines{
\vec{ds}
\\
=one\ of\ the\ three:
\\
\rightarrow \vec{ds_{x}} = dydz\hat{x}
\\
\rightarrow \vec{ds_{y}} = dxdz\hat{y}
\\
\rightarrow \vec{ds_{z}} = dxdy\hat{z}
}
$$
- notice how all will result in a tiny area element, which we can use to represent some perspective of the overall object
- also, another thing to realize is that this is a **cross-product** of dx hat(x) and dy hat(y), etc..
3. volume (dv)
- perhaps the simplest.
- it's just the volume created by dx, dy, and dz:
$$
dv=dxdydz
$$
> ^ just keep in mind it is **scalar**!!
