~~~
to figure out the electric field generated by an object at a point p:

we need to look at dE, a differential electrical field element
~~~
- the idea is that there is many, many dE's ('baby electric fields'), each resulting from a dQ ('baby charge') on the object
	- also, each differential charge region on the object has a different distance vector pointing towards p

### 1. dE resulting from a single dQ
- this is straight-forward. we just treat dQ as a point charge and use the formula for the E-field that results from such a scenario:
$$
\displaylines{
\vec{dE}=\frac{dQ}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r^2}\ \hat{r}
\\\\
but\  dQ=\rho_{V}dV from\ the\ previous\ lecture 
\\\\
giving\ us:
\\\\
\vec{dE}=\frac{\rho_{V}dV}{4\pi \epsilon_{0}r^2}\ \hat{r} \\
\uparrow \\ important
}
$$
### 2. the total E
- simply the sum of all dE over the volume
	- needs an integral
$$
\vec{E} = \int_{V}\vec{dE}
$$
- into this, we can sub in dE from the previous formula.
