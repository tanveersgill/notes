math 117 flashbacks. i thought i wouldn't see these again 🤠
anywho,

- instead of x and y, points are represented by their radius and angle (r and 𝞿)

moving between cartesian and polar, some relationships hold true:
~~~
     ,/|
 r ,/  |
 ,/	   | y
/𝞿_____|
    x
~~~
$$
\displaylines{
x^{2}+y^{2}=r^{2}
\\
sin(𝞿)=\frac{y}{r}\ and\ y=rsin(𝞿)
\\
cos(𝞿)=\frac{x}{r}\ and\ x=rcos(𝞿)
\\
tan(𝞿) = \frac{sin(𝞿)}{cos(𝞿)} = \frac{(\frac{y}{r})}{(\frac{x}{r})} = \frac{y}{x}
}
$$
***why are polar coordinates useful?***
- simplify certain calculations, such as the area of a circlee
