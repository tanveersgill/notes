- k is Coulomb's constant; 
	`8.99x10^9 Nm^2c^-2`
	`= 1/4ùûπœµ`

### superposition principle
- with more than 2 charges, the net electrostatic force on each charge is the vector sum of all the electrostatic forces acting on it

### some assumptions are made in order to apply coulomb's law:
- the charged bodies have to be very small compared to r, the distance between the bodies
