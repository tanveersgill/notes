***the triboelectric effect***
- transfer of electrons (and thus charge) when we rub objects together
	
the ***triboelectric series*** is a chart that lists the tendency of an object to gain positive charge (lose electrons)
- materials higher up in the series are more likely to donate electrons

***conservation of charge***
- of course, charge is always conserved and we cannot create or destroy it for a system
- however, we can move charge around and create areas that have differing charges
