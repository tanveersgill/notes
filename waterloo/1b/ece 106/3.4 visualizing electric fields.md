- there are 2 ways to visualize E-fields, both having their own benefits

### 1. as a set of vectors
- useful for magnitude and direction of an E-field at specific points in space

### 2. as electric field lines running along the vectors
- good for observing flow
- also, dense areas are indicitive of stronger electric fields

### how to determine direction?
~~~
in this context, direction can be thought of as whether an attractive or repulsive force is experienced at a point
~~~
- introduce a positive test charge (q) at the point of concern
	- the direction of the field will depend on whether the source (Q) is positive or negative
$$
\displaylines
{\vec{E}\propto Q\ (larger\ charge\rightarrow larger\ magnitude\ field)
\\\vec{E}\propto\frac{1}{r^2}
}
$$
