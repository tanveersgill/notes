### vector fields
- a way to assign a vector for each point in space
- in this course, we will use them to observe electric and magnetic fields

- an electric field is simply a vector field that represents the **force per unit charge** that would be experienced by a small positive charge at any point in the field

### definition
- an electric field basically surrounds an electric charge, and it exerts forces on other charges in the field
	- either repelling or attracting these forces

***measuring electric fields***
- has to be done at some point in space
- essentially, the electric field due to Q at some point p in space is the electrostatic force that would be experienced by a positive *unit* charge if it were placed at p
$$
the\ electric\ field\ is\ denoted\ \vec{E}
$$
~~~
            E
   Q     p -->
   |-----|
	  r
~~~

- the electric field at a distance r from the source charge can be calculated as:
$$
\displaylines{
\vec{E}(r) = \lim_{q\to0}\frac{F_{Qq}}{r}
\\\\
= \lim_{q\to0}\frac{kQq}{qr^{2}}\ \hat{r}
\Rightarrow \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}\ \hat{r}
}
$$
- epsilon naught is the ***permetivity of free space*** (a constant)

***dealing with multiple source charges***
- what's nice about this is that superposition principle applies!
$$
if\ we\ have\ N\ sources,\ \vec{E}_{total}=\sum_{n=1}^{n=N}\vec{E}_{n}
$$
