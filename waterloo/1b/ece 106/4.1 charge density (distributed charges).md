> what if instead of a point, we're looking at an object as the source of an electric field?

~~~
to get an understanding of charge density:
what is mass density?
-> how much mass there is per unit of __ (length, surface area, or volume), right?
-> charge density is the same!
~~~
- this scenario is called a ***continuous charge distribution***; the object would have charge continuously distributed throughout its body 

- in examining the electric field from some point 'p', you have to consider the contributions by each small charged region of an object
	- this region may be a segment of a line, a segment of surface area, or of volume

***3 types of charge density:***
1. **linear** (ρ𝑙 / "rho L")
	- charge is distibuted in a line
	- ex. a string
		$$
	\displaylines{
	ρ_{𝑙}=\frac{dQ}{d𝑙}\ /\ dQ=\rho_{l}\ dl
	\\
	\rightarrow for\ a\ 'small'\ length,\ linear\ charge\ density\ is\ the\  charge\  of\  that\  small\  area/its\ length
	\\
	\rightarrow then,\ to\ compute\ the\ total\ charge\ in\ a\ line\ of\ length\ L:
	\\
	Q=\int_{L}\rho_{l}\ dl
	\\
	\uparrow
	\\
	notice\ if\ there\ is\ uniform\ distribution\ of\ charge,\ the\ density\ \rho_{l}\ is\ constant,\ yielding:
	\\
	Q=\rho_{l}\ L
	}
	$$
2. **surface** (ρs / "rho S")
	- when the charge in question is distributed throughout the surface of some object
	- same idea as linear, just with SA instead of length
		$$
	\displaylines{
	ρ_{s}=\frac{dQ}{ds}\ /\ dQ=\rho_{s}\ ds
	\\
	\rightarrow for\ a\ small\ piece\ of\ the\ surface\ area,\ the\ surface\ charge\ density\ is\ the\ charge\ in\ the\ piece\ / the\ area
	\\
	overall\ charge
	\\
	\downarrow
	\\
	Q=\int_{S}\rho_{s}\ ds
	\\
	\uparrow
	\\
	for\ uniform\ distribution\ of\ charge\ on\ the\ surface,\ the\ density\ \rho_{s}\ is\ constant,\ yielding:
	\\
	Q=\rho_{s}\ S
	}
	$$
3. **volume** (ρv / "rho V")
	- the pattern should be clear by now lmao I ain't writing all that again
	- just know that now we take an infinitesimal volume, and then to get a total charge we'd have to integrate over the volume
