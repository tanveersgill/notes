# 1.05 (local variables)

- literal data needs to be hard coded into a program before compilation
    - this is useless when the program is supposed to react to different input, like from the real world

- data is stored in
    - local variables
        - they are lost when main() exits

**integers**

```cpp
//local variable declaration
int n;
```

this says: 

- n will temporarily store an integer value
- it is a local variable

int is a keyword that describes the *type* of the local variable

- weâ€™re declaring n to be of type int

```cpp
std::cin >> n;
```

this says: 

- call an appropriate subroutine that will wait for the user to enter an integer and assign that value to n

**characters**

```cpp
char ch;
```

this tells the compiler:

- the identifier ch will be temporarily used to store a character

char is, like int, a keyword

**strings**

```cpp
std::string str
```

this tells the compiler:

- the identifier str will be used to temporarily store an instance of the string class
- std::string consists of the namespace std and identifier string
    - the type of str is std::string
    

**double**

same as above, but for floating point numbers

**booleans**

- although the literals are true and false, user can only enter 0 or 1

**type** 

- It tells the compiler how a particular value gets stored in memory
- As an example, type int lets us store integers from -2147483648 to 2147483648.
