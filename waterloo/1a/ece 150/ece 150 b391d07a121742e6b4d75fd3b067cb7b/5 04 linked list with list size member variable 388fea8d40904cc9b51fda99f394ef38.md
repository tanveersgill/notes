# 5.04 linked list with list size member variable

- just have a variable that is set to zero initially, for an empty linked list
    - then, only change it when there is a call to a function that changes the number of nodes in the linked list, whether increasing or decreasing it
    - these are the ones that clear, add to front, and remove from front
