# 1.36 c-style strings

- we use the null character in a character array to flag the end of a string
    - character arrays without null characters are NOT strings
    - fortunately for us, character arrays have null characters by default
- Literal strings (std::string) CANNOT be changed
    - char arrays can be useful in this sense since we can alter them

***trying to print a char array:***

```cpp
char someString[100]{'n' , 'o' , '.'};

std::cout << someString << std::endl;
```
