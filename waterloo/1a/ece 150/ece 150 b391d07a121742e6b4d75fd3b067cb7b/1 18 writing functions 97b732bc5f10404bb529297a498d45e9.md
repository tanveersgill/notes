# 1.18 writing functions

- like pieces of code that let us repeatedly use the same code in different situations as required
- ***parts of a function definition***
    
    → identifier (name)
    
    → parameter and parameter type
    
    → return type
    
    → function body (anything between the two braces)
    

- parameters are just like local variables, and their scope remains restricted to the function into which they are passed
