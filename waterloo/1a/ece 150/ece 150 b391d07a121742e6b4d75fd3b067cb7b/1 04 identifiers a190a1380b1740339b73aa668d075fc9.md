# 1.04 identifiers

- ***identifiers***
    - **definition:** any sequence of an underscore/letter followed by underscores/letters/numbers
    - some are associated with the language
    - others let a programmer refer to something of significance to the program
        - ex. int, main, std, std::cout, return
    - used to refer to:
        - local variables, parameters, functions, types, classes
    - some are keywords
    - the first time the identifier is seen is the declaration
        - this is also where we see its purpose
    

***naming conventions***

- we will use snake-case:
    - Linked_list
    - is_sorted
    - array_capacity

***reserved identifiers (reserved by compiler)***

- never define an identifier starting with an underscore
- do not have two adjacent underscores

***keywords***

- they can’t be used for any other purpose, and are reserved by the language to identify specific features in the language
- not “main”, since we have defined that
- there are about 100 in C++
