# 1.15 the structured programming theorem

***goto statement***

- lets you jump to previous lines in your code
- DO NOT use it in this course

***what it says***

- any program that can be written can be written with just conditional (if/else if/else) and repetition (for/while loop) statements

***think of the theorem as a guide:***

- always think of looping while a condition is true.
    - understand when you need to terminate that loop
- always ask boolean valued questions
